### Hello! :wave: Glad to have you here. Make yourself comfortable and grab some coffee! :coffee:

:man_student: I'm Mateus Karvat, Computer Scientist from Cascavel-PR in the south of Brazil. I graduated from [UNIOESTE](https://www.unioeste.br/portal/) in 2022.

:microscope: During my BSc I have done undergraduate research in Quantum Computing and Deep Learning, as well as organizing outreach events with the [PETComp group](https://petsite-bd39a.web.app/). A few papers based on these projects have been [published in national and international journals and conferences](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=0NHCSV4AAAAJ).

I love learning new things and consider myself to be a [multipotentialite](https://puttylike.com/terminology/). For hobbies, I love gaming :video_game:, TV Shows (Huge Mr Robot :man_technologist: and Star Trek :vulcan_salute: fan) and Formula 1 :racing_car:.

:incoming_envelope: You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-karvat-camara/) or by email (mkarvat at gmail dot com).
